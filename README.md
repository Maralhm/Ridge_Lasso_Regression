Linear Regression Issues (READ ME):
Linear regression assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. It can overfit data with many features, leading to poor generalization to new data. Moreover, it struggles with multicollinearity, where independent variables are highly correlated.

# Lasso Regression
Lasso regression simplifies complex models by automatically selecting important features and shrinking less significant ones to zero. It overcomes overfitting in datasets with numerous features, promoting simplicity and interpretability.

# Ridge Regression
Ridge regression prevents overfitting and stabilizes model estimates, especially when dealing with correlated variables. By shrinking less important features, it improves model reliability, making it suitable for complex datasets.

Both Lasso and Ridge regression address the limitations of linear regression, ensuring more accurate predictions and robust models in scenarios where overfitting and multicollinearity are prevalent. They strike a balance between model complexity and performance, making them valuable tools in modern data analysis.
